Kenbot was created as Christian Cheng and Josh Ramos's final web app project for UC San Diego's Summer Program for Incoming Students. The user thinks of a person, and Kenbot guesses who this person is, by asking a series of yes/no questions (similarly to the common game, "20 Questions"). The person in mind must be a SPIS student, professor, or mentor.
