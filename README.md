# SPIS15-Project-Web-Josh-Christian

For our final web app project, we are creating an online game where the user will think of a person, and the computer will guess who the person is by asking a series of yes or no questions. The person in mind must be a SPIS student, professor, or mentor. We are planning to use a sorting algorithm to eliminate persons based on the questions asked. Once all but one person have been eliminated, the remaining person will be presented as the computer's answer.
